## ESP In. De. Data Emulator

This is a very simple [Processing](https://processing.org/) program designed to reproduce the same WebSocket communication protocol used by the *ESP In. De* hardware. This allows for easy testing and iteration entirely on a computer, without needing to flash the ESP MCU every time a change is made.

This tool is primarily useful only for development and testing.

Processing was chosen because of its multi-platform nature, similarity to the Arduino IDE (which many users of this project will already be familiar with), and overall accessibility amd speed of iteration.
