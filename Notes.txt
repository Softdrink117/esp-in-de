Recommended circuit for handling the inputs (per Hatsune Mike):

Button
|
|--- level-shifting buffer (e.g. 74LVCH16245) --> GPIO input (in non-pullup mode)
|
PCB

IDT74LVCH16245A explicitly calls out "All pins can be driven from either 3.3V or 5V devices"
"This feature allows the use of this device as a translator in a mixed 3.3/5V supply system."
you can just die DIR and OE to GND, hook up the inputs to bus B, and read bus A using the MCU/Rpi/whatever
